Aim - Write a Java program to create an Employee class where an Overloaded constructor initializes employee details.The default constructor should Initialize name as "Unknown" and salary as 0 and the second constructor initializes the name and sets a default salary.  Create a method DisplayEmployeeDetails() to display employee information.
code :
Employee Class
class Employee {

    private String name;

    private double salary;

    public Employee() {

        this.name = "Unknown"; 

        this.salary = 0.0;    
    }

 
    public Employee(String name) {

        this.name = name;

        this.salary = 30000.0; 

    }

 
    public void displayEmployeeDetails() {

        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + this.name);

        System.out.println("Employee Salary: " + this.salary);

    }

}

public class EmployeeTest {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Employee emp1 = new Employee();

        System.out.println("Details of Employee 1:");

        emp1.displayEmployeeDetails();

 

        System.out.println();
        Employee emp2 = new Employee("Alice");

        System.out.println("Details of Employee 2:");

        emp2.displayEmployeeDetails();

    }

}

output:
Details of Employee 1:
Employee Name: Unknown
Employee Salary: 0.0

Details of Employee 2:
Employee Name: Alice
Employee Salary: 30000.0
